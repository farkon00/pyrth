  // TODO: `print` intrinsics cannot print negative numbers
  //
  // To be honest, I'm not sure if we still need it to be an intrinsic.
  // `print` intrinsic was introduce as a hack early on in the development
  // and quite frankly is not needed anymore since we can reimplement it
  // in porth relatively easily using `putu` or the like.
  //
  // However, it is very handy during the debugging of the compiler when you don't want
  // to include the entire standard library since it will clutter the compiler output.
  // This could be fixed by implementing dead code elimination though.
