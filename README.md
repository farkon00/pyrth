# Pyrth

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! THIS LANGUAGE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! ANYTHING CAN CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT WITHOUT ANY NOTICE! USE THIS LANGUAGE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

Most of code in this repository was written not by its owner on github, but by [Tsoding(Alexey Kutepov)](https://github.com/rexim) and other contributors to original Porth compiler.

Porth is a [Concatenative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language) [Stack-Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) [Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) for [Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer)

Pyrth is alternative compiler for porth, created to compile it to Python. It reuses code from original compiler.

*(If you never heard about this kind of languages before check out [https://concatenative.org/](https://concatenative.org/))*

## Examples

Hello, World:

```porth
include "std.porth"

proc main in
  "Hello, World\n" puts
end
```

Simple program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 in an ascending order:

```porth
include "std.porth"

proc main in
  0 while dup 100 < do
    dup print 1 +
  end drop
end
```

## Quick Start

### Bootstrapping

Since Porth is self-hosted you need to bootstrap it first. There are some pre-compiled assembly files in [./bootstrap/](./bootstrap/) folder that you can use for that.

First you will need to install [fasm](https://flatassembler.net/) and make sure it's available in `$PATH`.

```console
$ fasm -m 524288 ./bootstrap/porth-linux-x86_64.fasm
$ chmod +x ./bootstrap/porth-linux-x86_64
$ ./bootstrap/porth-linux-x86_64 com ./porth.porth
$ ./porth com ./porth.porth
$ ./porth com ./porth.porth
$ ./porth com ./porth.porth
...
```

### Compilation

Compilation generates assembly code and compiles it with [fasm](https://flatassembler.net/). So make sure you have it available in your `$PATH`.

```console
$ cat program.porth
proc main in
  34 35 + print
end
$ ./porth com program.porth
...
... compilation logs ...
...
$ ./program
69
```

### Testing

Test cases are located in [./tests/](./tests/) folder. The `*.txt` files contain inputs (command line arguments, stdin) and expected outputs (exit code, stdout, stderr) of the corresponding programs.

Run [./test.py](./test.py) script to execute the programs and assert their outputs:

```console
$ ./test.py run
```

To updated expected outputs of the programs run the `update` subcommand:

```console
$ ./test.py update
```

To update expected command line arguments and stdin of a specific program run the `update input <path/to/program.porth>` subcommand:

```console
$ ./test.py update input ./tests/argv.porth new cmd args
[INFO] Provide the stdin for the test case. Press ^D when you are done...
Hello, World
^D
[INFO] Saving input to ./tests/argv.txt
```

The [./examples/](./examples/) folder contains programs that are ment for showcasing the language rather then testing it, but we still can use them for testing just like the stuff in the [./tests/](./tests/) folder:

```console
$ ./test.py run ./examples/
$ ./test.py update input ./examples/name.porth
$ ./test.py update output ./examples/
```

For more info see `./test.py help`

### Usage

If you wanna use the Porth compiler separately from its codebase you only need two things:
- `./porth` native executable - the compiler itself (see [Bootstrapping](#bootstrapping) for more info on how to get it),
- [./std/](./std/) - the standard library.

By default the compiler searches files to include in `./` and `./std/`. You can add more search paths via the `-I` flag before the subcommand: `./porth -I <custom-path> com ...`. See `./porth help` for more info.

### Editor Support

<!-- TODO: document editor support -->

See [./editor/](./editor/) folder.

## Language Reference

This is what the language supports so far. **Since the language is a work in progress everything in this section is the subject to change.**

### Literals

#### Integer

Currently an integer is a sequence of decimal digits that optionally starts with a dash (`-`) to indicate a negative integer. When an integer is encountered it is pushed onto the data stack for processing by the relevant operations.

Example:

```porth
10 20 +
```

The code above pushes 10 and 20 onto the data stack and sums them up with `+` operation.

#### String

Currently a string is any sequence of bytes sandwiched between two `"`. No newlines inside of the strings are allowed. No special support for Unicode is provided right now. You can escape only these things for now:
- `\n` - new line
- `\r` - carriage return
- `\\` - back slash
- `\"` - double quote
- `\'` - single quote

When the compiler encounters a string:
1. the size of the string in bytes is pushed onto the data stack,
2. the bytes of the string are copied somewhere into the memory (the exact location is implementation specific),
3. the pointer to the beginning of the string is pushed onto the data stack.

Those, a single string pushes two values onto the data stack: the size and the pointer.

Example:

```porth
include "std.porth"

proc main in
  "Hello, World" puts
end
```

The `puts` procedure from `std.porth` module expects two values on the data stack:
1. the size of the buffer it needs to print,
2. the pointer to the beginning of the buffer.

The size and the pointer are provided by the string `"Hello, World"`.

#### C-style String

It's like a regular string but it does not push its size on the stack and implicitly ends with [NULL-terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string). Designed specifically to interact with C code or any other kind of code that expects NULL-terminated strings.

```porth
include "std.porth"

proc main in
  0 O_RDONLY "input.txt"c AT_FDCWD openat
  //                    ^
  //                    |
  //                    postfix that indicates a C-style string

  dup 0 < if
    "ERROR: could not open the file\n" eputs
    1 exit
  end

  "Successfully opened the file!\n" puts

  close drop
end
```

Here we are using [openat(2)](https://linux.die.net/man/2/openat) Linux syscall to open a file. The syscall expects the pathname to be a NULL-terminated string.

#### Character

Currently a character is a single byte sandwiched between two `'`. Escaping works the same as in regular strings.

When compiler encounters a character it pushes its value as an integer onto the stack.

Example:

```porth
proc main in
  'E' print
end
```

This program pushes integer `69` onto the stack (since the ASCII code of letter `E` is `69`) and prints it with the `print` operation.

#### System

- `syscall<n>` - perform a syscall with n arguments where n is in range `[0..6]`. (`syscall1`, `syscall2`, etc)

```porth
syscall_number = pop()
<move syscall_number to the corresponding register>
for i in range(n):
    arg = pop()
    <move arg to i-th register according to the call convention>
<perform the syscall>
```

#### Misc

- `here (-- [len: int] [str: ptr])` - pushes a string `"<file-path>:<row>:<col>"` where `<file-path>` is the path to the file where `here` is located, `<row>` is the row on which `here` is located and `<col>` is the column from which `here` starts. It is useful for reporting developer errors:

```porth
include "std.porth"

proc main in
  here puts ": FIXME: not implemented yet\n" puts
  1 exit
end
```

- `argc (-- [argc: int])`
- `argv (-- [argv: ptr])`
